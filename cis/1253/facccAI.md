1.  Could you please explain the basics of AI to us and how it is best used in an educational setting?
  * AI in general: the boundary where machines approach human abilities.
  * Strong AI: a branch of AI where machines are to perform *general* (as opposed to specific) intelligent tasks.
  * GPT: *Generative Pre-trained Transformer*
    * *Generative* means the mechanism is designed to generate a stream of output, as opposed to the more conventional fixed output in response to an input.
    * *Pre-trained* means the model (Large Language Model, LLM) is trained by numerous samples. The model is typically a neural network that is trained using a mechanism called back-propagation.
    * *Transformer* refers to a specific mechanism where the model maintains an "attention" window and uses parts of the generated output as feedback to the input.
    * At the core, a GPT is an imitation engine based on the material used to train it.
  * How to use AI in education:
    * As a tutor/mentor. A GPT can be provided with specific instructional material, and be instructed to:
      * Rephrase and change the presentation of the material.
      * Answer questions regarding the material.
2.  Considering the implications of AIâ€™s potential to impact the role of both instructor and student, should faculty modify their teaching in the age of AI, and if so, how?
3.  What AI skills will benefit students post-education?
4.  What are the impacts, positive and/or negative, you've observed so far of AI in education?
5.  What are words of advice to both faculty and students struggling to understand the appropriate role of AI in teaching and learning?
