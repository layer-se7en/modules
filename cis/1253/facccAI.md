1.  Could you please explain the basics of AI to us and how it is best used in an educational setting?
  * AI in general: the boundary where machines approach human abilities.
  * Strong AI: a branch of AI where machines are to perform *general* (as opposed to specific) intelligent tasks.
  * GPT: *Generative Pre-trained Transformer*
    * *Generative* means the mechanism is designed to generate a stream of output, as opposed to the more conventional fixed output in response to an input.
    * *Pre-trained* means the model (Large Language Model, LLM) is trained by numerous samples. The model is typically a neural network that is trained using a mechanism called back-propagation.
    * *Transformer* refers to a specific mechanism where the model maintains an "attention" window and uses parts of the generated output as feedback to the input.
    * At the core, a GPT is an imitation engine based on the material used to train it.
  * How to use AI in education:
    * As a tutor/mentor. A GPT can be provided with specific instructional material and be instructed to:
      * Rephrase and change the presentation of the material.
      * Answer questions regarding the material.
2.  Considering the implications of AIâ€™s potential to impact the role of both instructor and student, should faculty modify their teaching in the age of AI, and if so, how?
  * Modification? Maybe. Awareness? Yes!
  * Need to teach students how to use AI to enhance their education, not as a shortcut.
  * As a tool, AI can propel some to achieve more in the long run.
  * As a shortcut, AI can impede some in the long run.
  * The difference is what question to ask.
    * Asking AI to explain a concept.
    * Asking AI to generate sample questions and evaluate corresponding answers.
    * Asking AI for knowledge.
3.  What AI skills will benefit students post-education?
  * How to use AI as a teaching assistant/aid who can help patiently explain concepts and is available 24/7.
  * Expectations from employers.
    * Industry/career-dependent and changes rapidly.
  * Not so much a skill, but an awareness of what AI cannot do, at least not very well. This is why *people* are hired.
    * Critical thinking.
    * Rigor in the application of logic.
    * Problem-solving.
4.  What are the impacts, positive and/or negative, you've observed so far of AI in education?
  * Students who use AI as a shortcut, especially those taking classes where assessment cannot be authenticated, will encounter a rude awakening after graduation.
  * "Custom GPTs" (in ChatGPT) can be effective as a tutor/mentor on specific topics (TTPASM example).
5.  What are words of advice to both faculty and students struggling to understand the appropriate role of AI in teaching and learning?
